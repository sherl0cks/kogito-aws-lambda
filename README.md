# kogito-aws-lambda

This is a combination of https://quarkus.io/guides/amazon-lambda-http, https://quarkus.io/guides/kogito and 
https://quarkus.io/guides/kotlin focused on native builds. Kogito is a new framework for drools and jbpm and that will 
automatically build JAX-RS scaffolding for your rules and process files. The amazon lambda http extension will expose 
those JAX-RS endpoints over AWS lambda and API gateway by fowarding all requests received by the lambda to localhost 
host via netty.

On my tests with 128 MB, cold starts with first execution was 1100ms. Second execution was 8ms. Sweeeeeeet.

## Warning
Kogito is not yet 1.0. APIs could change. Things could break. We'll need to proceed with caution.

# TODO
Probably time to bite the java 11 bullet, but that doesn't work with amazon lambda http extension.

## Steps to deploy to AWS Lambda.
1. Install SAM local: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html
2. Install graal. This was tested against 20.1.0-java8 installed via sdkman https://sdkman.io/
3. Build the native image: `./mvnw clean install -Dnative -Dquarkus.native.builder-image=quay.io/quarkus/ubi-quarkus-native-image:20.1.0-java8`
4. Login into your AWS account for your cli and make sure you have an s3 bucket you can use for deploy artifacts.
5. Package it for AWS lambda: `sam package --template-file target/sam.native.yaml --output-template-file packaged-native.yaml --s3-bucket <your-bucket-here>`
6. Deploy it for AWS lambda: `sam deploy --template-file packaged-native.yaml --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM --stack-name <your-stack-name-here>`
7. Get the URL of the API Gateway exposing your lambda (see outputs): `aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name <your-stack-name>`
8. Hit the URL: 
```
 curl -X POST <your-endpoint-here>/persons \                                                                    
    -H 'content-type: application/json' \
    -H 'accept: application/json' \
    -d '{"person": {"name":"John Quark", "age": 20}}'

```

## Testing

Looks like the best way to test is to use `@QuarkusTest`, which will spin up the JAX-RS server in memory, and then [RestAssured](https://rest-assured.io/). This supports an outside in testing pattern, and the server only takes a 1-2 seconds to spin up, but this may get frustrating if we want to test a small unit.
